Hetzner CLI example app and packages

This is a work in progress, not feature complete, reading info only for now.

For now, $HOME/.hcli.conf should contain:

	huser = username
	hpass = password

for the api user you've setup at hetzner's robot web interface.

See the 'hcli' app for more 'documentation'.  More to be put here in the
future.
